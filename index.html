        <p> Welcome to my website! I am a senior at Dartmouth College studying Physics and Astronomy. My advisor is <a href="https://hickox.host.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank"> Dr Ryan Hickox</a> and I am co-advised by <a href="https://gpetter.github.io/" target="_blank">Grayson Petter</a>. Last summer, I was an REU student at Northwestern University's Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA). I was advised by <a href="https://giacomofragione90.wixsite.com/giacomofragione" target="blank">Dr Giacomo Fragione</a> and Dr Fred Rasio.

        I am interested in studying the formation, growth, and evolution of black holes over cosmic history. I am particularly intrigued by intermediate-mass black holes since they have been a missing piece of our current black hole puzzle.

        <h2> AGNs in dwarf galaxies in the Bo&oumltes field</h2>
        <img src="lum.png">  <div class="para"> Submitted to ApJ. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three candidate AGNs in dwarf galaxies in the Bo&oumltes field. Dwarf galaxies are particularly interesting hosts for AGNs as they may contain central black holes that have not grown significantly since the epoch of their formation in the early universe. Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we find three X-ray luminous dwarf galaxies and we assess their candidacy as AGNs with standard emission-line diagnostics. We compute the X-ray, mid-infrared, and [O III] luminosities and compare them to established relationships in the literature. We fit various star-forming and AGN templates to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We use various scaling relations, in particular the relationship between BH mass and stellar velocity dispersion, to estimate the masses of the BHs to be 10<sup>5</sup> - 10<sup>6</sup> M<sub>&#8857</sub>, in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) regime. Finally, we find these systems to be obscured  and accreting at high Eddington ratios. <br> <br><br>

    <h2> Binary black hole meregers in dense clusters with a stellar runaway </h2>
        <img src="Massive_BH.png">
        <div class="para"> Submitted to ApJ. Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are believed to be the missing link between supermassive BHs that reside at the centers of massive galaxies and BHs formed as a result of stellar collapse. One of the proposed mechanisms for their formation is the stellar runaway process, where a very massive star forms from repeated stellar mergers and eventually collapses to an IMBH. In this paper, we investigate this scenario by looking at the gravitational wave (GW) events produced by this IMBH when merging with other BHs in the host star cluster. We use a state-of-the-art semi-analytic method to characterize the rates and properties of IMBH-BH mergers, as a function of the initial fraction of the initial cluster mass that collapses to from the IMBH. We also study the prospects of the detection of these mergers by current and future GW observatories, both space-based (LISA) and ground-based (LIGO's Voyager, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer). We find that most of these merger events could be detected, with some of them being multi-band sources. Therefore, GWs represent a unique tool to test the runaway scenario and to constrain the population of IMBHs.
