        <p> Welcome to my website! I am a senior at Dartmouth College studying Physics and Astronomy.  My advisor is <a href="https://hickox.host.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank"> Dr Ryan Hickox</a> and I am co-advised by <a href="https://gpetter.github.io/" target="_blank">Grayson Petter</a>. Last summer, I was an REU student at Northwestern University's Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA). I was advised by <a href="https://giacomofragione90.wixsite.com/giacomofragione" target="blank">Dr Giacomo Fragione </a> and Dr Fred Rasio.

        I am interested in studying the formation, growth, and evolution of black holes over cosmic history. I am particularly intrigued by intermediate-mass black holes since they have been a missing piece of our current black hole puzzle.

        <h2> AGNs in dwarf galaxies in the Bo&oumltes field</h2>
       <br> <img src="lum.png">  <div class="para"> Submitted to ApJ. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three candidate AGNs in dwarf galaxies in the Bo&oumltes field. Dwarf galaxies are particularly interesting hosts for AGNs as they may contain central black holes that have not grown significantly since the epoch of their formation in the early universe. Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we find three X-ray luminous dwarf galaxies and we assess their candidacy as AGNs with standard emission-line diagnostics. We compute the X-ray, mid-infrared, and [O III] luminosities and compare them to established relationships in the literature. We fit various star-forming and AGN templates to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We use various scaling relations, in particular the relationship between BH mass and stellar velocity dispersion, to estimate the masses of the BHs to be 10<sup>5</sup> - 10<sup>6</sup> M<sub>&#8857</sub>, in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) regime. Finally, we find these systems to be obscured  and accreting at high Eddington ratios. <br> <br><br>

    <h2> Binary black hole meregers in dense clusters with a stellar runaway </h2>
        <img src="Massive_BH.png">
        <div class="para"> Submitted to ApJ. We investigate the repeated hierarchical mergers of stellar-mass BHs. We present a semi-analytic study of the rates and properties of binary BH (BBH) mergers in dense clusters with a stellar runaway effect. In the runaway effect, stars merge together before they collapse into BHs thus  forming a large blue straggler star that may collapse into higher-mass stellar BH. After a merger of these BHs, the remnant may fall into the mass range of an IMBH. We study these BBH mergers by modelling a cluster where these runaway events are common and occur for a fraction of the initial cluster mass. We study the probability of the detection of these mergers by  current and future GW telescopes. We find that most of these merger events will be detected by ground- and space-based telescopes, with some even being multi-band sources.
